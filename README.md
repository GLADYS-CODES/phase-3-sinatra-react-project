This project was made to practice creating and using a relational database and API using Ruby, Active Record, and Sinatra. The front end was made using React.

When users visit the page they are greeted with a message letting them know the intention of the website.


The navigation bar at the top of the page lets users know what pages the site has. They can post their own advice and decide what name they want the advice credited to, Browse all posted pieces of advice, or have the site display a piece of advice at random.


To experiment with the app here's the link http://localhost:3000
